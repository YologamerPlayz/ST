# Project ΤΛ για το έτος 2025.

## Getting Started:
For the database, you will have to name your connection TL with user="root" and password="12345". Run the create and insert files and you are done on that front. As for the Java code, you will need to add to your lib folder (if you don't have one, make one inside your project's directory) the following libraries:

MySQL ConnectorJ - link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=538917, JCalendar - link: https://www.toedter.com/download/jcalendar-1.4.zip

Make sure to also add them to your project's build path by right clicking Build Path -> Configure Build Path... -> Select Classpath with your mouse -> Add JARs. These instructions work for the Eclipse IDE. 

After all the above preparations are done, run MainApp.java and you are all set.


## Known Issues:
Upon clicking "View Calendar" in the Technician Dashboard, the window might somewhat bug out/freeze. Simply minimizing/maximizing said window should fix things.
